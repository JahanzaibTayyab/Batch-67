# The `print` statement in Python is a built-in function used to display output on the screen. It takes one or more items, converts them into a string if needed, and shows them in the console or standard output. For example:

# ```python
# print("Hello, World!")
# ```

# This outputs:  
# **Hello, World!**

# It is commonly used to show messages, display variable values, and debug programs.

print("Hello, World! This is my first python program")
print('Kamran')
print('Khan')
print('Hassan')
