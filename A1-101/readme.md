## Google Colab: The Development Environment

We will use **Google Colab** as the primary platform for development due to its simplicity and powerful features. Google Colab is a free, cloud-based Jupyter Notebook service developed by Google.

### Why Use Google Colab?

- **No Setup Required**: Start coding without installing software or managing environments.
- **Free Access to Computing Resources**: Leverage free GPUs and TPUs for machine learning and data analysis tasks.
- **Collaboration**: Share and collaboratively edit notebooks, similar to Google Docs.
- **Integration with Google Drive**: Notebooks are stored in Google Drive for seamless access and organization.
- **Support for Popular Libraries**: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, and more are supported.

### Recent Developments

Google has expanded Colab's **AI-powered code assistance** to all users in eligible locales, providing:

- Code generation from natural language prompts.
- An AI chatbot for programming assistance and comprehension.

### Getting Started with Google Colab

1. **Access Colab**: Visit the [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) website.
2. **Create a New Notebook**: Go to "File" > "New Notebook" to start a new Jupyter Notebook.
3. **Write and Execute Code**: Enter Python code in the cells and run them to see results.
4. **Save and Share**: Notebooks are saved in Google Drive, and you can share them with others using the "Share" button.

For more details, refer to the [Colab FAQ](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/faq.html) and [Colab Help Center](https://support.google.com/colaboratory/).
